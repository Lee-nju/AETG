# AETG
Simple two implementation of AETG algorithm

Here i give two different implementation with similar ideas.Both implementation use C++ language. With two different purpose,
the former purpose is to generate minimum testcase as less time as possible, the latter purpose is also to generate minimum 
testcase without putting time savings first.

We call the first AETG1 and the second AETG2
